The Cognitive Distortion Journal (CDJ) is a smart journaling tool that helps remedy distorted thinking. It can feel impossible to follow the CBT technique of labeling distorted thinking and finding alternative modes of thought (i.e. reframing) while cognitive distortions are occurring. The CDJ does that work for you.
